<p>The world is shattered. The gods have abandoned you. Once, many decades ago, this civilization was alive with trade and culture; wealthy beyond compare. Now it lies in ruins, the survivors are the inheritors of this tragedy. They shuffle, from ruin to ruin trying to survive; living off the scraps of their ancestors. </p>

<p>However; despite this despair, there are beacons of light. Places where humanity has gained a foothold. These beacons are few and far between, and they must remain intact if humanity is ever going to recover.</p>


<p>There are some though that wish to destroy this progress and plunge the world back to the worst depths of the dark ages. These misanthropes, called The Cult of the End, or colloquially, The Cult.</p>


<p>There are excited rumors, spoken in hushed tones. Those chosen few who communicate with things unseen; they speak of the return of the gods. The gods who were scorned by the arrogance of man so long ago. Though many feel anger and resent for the situation that the gods have allowed to develop, many more are excited about the possibility of rebuilding.</p>
